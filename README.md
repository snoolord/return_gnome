In Return Gnome!, a fairy has taken control of the forest and keeps moving the gnomes' homes to random places. Players needs to help them get back home using their flexbox skills.

# Dynamic jQuery

The gnome(s) on the right change dynamically just like if you were writing CSS in Chrome Dev Tools.

# Local storage

Remember where you left off when you refresh.

Local storage will be later used to fill in  answers for levels that have been completed.

# Architecture and Frameworks

* Used jQuery for most of the game logic
* Implemented Animate.css to provide animations

# Future Additions

More CSS techniques other than flex and transform.
Better use of local storage to manage game sessions.
